# projects
Page for keeping project progress and ideas
We have project night once a month (every other meetup, which are bi-weekly)

Some ideas for future meetups:  
D3 using geoJSON with leaflet plugin or 3d views  
D3 for charts, replacing google charts  
R for mapping -maybe too complex?  
GDAL, OGR, postGIS  
MacPorts  
geocaching  
More OSM
